### Daily homework, reading, quiz dates [dailyhomework]

Looking for the [weekly homework](#weeklyhomework)?

These problems are not to be turned in, but all quiz problems will come verbatim from daily problem sets. It's a good idea to keep up with them as best you can. Some of them are repetitive. I trust you to use your discretion and work as many problems as you need to, until you understand what's happening.

### Weekly homework [weeklyhomework]

Looking for the [daily homework](#dailyhomework)?

This is a senior-level mathematics course, and your homework should reflect the high level of professionalism you have developed in your studies. It should be clear, concise, readable, and grammatically correct; it should be made of paragraphs that are themselves made of sentences; and it should be convincing. If there is a gap in your argument, don't try to hide it. Point it out and indicate exactly what is missing. Unsatisfactory write-ups earn no credit, no matter how obvious the underlying reasoning might appear to you.

If you are interested in typing your homework, I encourage you to learn the typesetting system \\(\mathrm{\LaTeX}\\). It is a valuable skill for people who plan to do any amount of scientific writing, and it is much easier today than it once was. I have loved using it for an embarrassingly long time and am happy to help you. See me if you are interested in getting started; you can learn most of what you'll need for homework sets in an afternoon (it's fun). All my syllabi, quizzes, exams, and other course handouts are typeset in \\(\mathrm{\LaTeX}\\), as are most professional mathematical books and articles (including graduate dissertations---at least, the dissertations of people who finish on time and do not have to hire Word professionals).

#### Problem Set 8: Sections 4.3--4.5 <br /> due Friday, May 3.
- Section 4.3: 2, 3 (hint: use the ML-estimate), 5.
- Section 4.4: 4, 10.
- Section 4.5: 2, 6, 8.

#### Problem Set 7: Sections 3.3--3.5 <br /> due Monday, April 22.
- Section 3.3: 5, 11, 15, try 19.
- Section 3.4: 5, 6.
- Section 3.5: 5, 6, 7.

#### Problem Set 6: Sections 3.1--3.2 <br /> due Friday, April 12
- Section 3.1: 7, 14.

#### Problem Set 5: Sections 2.3--2.7 
- Section 2.3: 16.
- Section 2.4: 7, 8. Also read and think about 9--14. These kinds of results have wider applicability than you might guess.
- Section 2.5: 13. (You will probably need the result of 12, but the proof of 12 is not hard.)
- Section 2.6: 1--3. The pictures are enough (you don't need to discuss them at any length) but I want you to really think about them. Draw *big*, *beautiful* pictures for this problem.
- Section 2.7: 2. (Ape the solution of Example 1.) 

#### Problem Set 4: Sections 2.1--2.2
- Section 2.1: 12, 13; Bonus: 14, 15. 
- Section 2.2: 9, 12, 25. 

#### Problem Set 3: Sections 1.6--1.7
- Section 1.6: 11, 12, 16; Bonus: 17.  
- Section 1.7: 6, 8, 9.  

#### Problem Set 2: Sections 1.4--1.5
- Section 1.4: 11 (with proofs or counterexamples), 18, 20, 22, 23.  
- Section 1.5: 1, 8, 10. 

#### Problem Set 1: Sections 1.1--1.3
- Section 1.1: 15--17, 24, 25; Bonus: 30.
- Section 1.2: 6, 8, 10, 11.
- Section 1.3: 10, 11, 22; Bonus: 28.

On your first weekly grade report, the problems correspond as follows: 1.1.17; 1.1.24; (1.1.30); 1.2.8; 1.3.22; (1.3.28); 1.4.11; 1.5.10. Bonus problems appear in parentheses. They can contribute to the numerator when I calculate your homework score, but they contribute 0 to the denominator.</p>
