<p>These problems are not to be turned in, but all quiz problems will come verbatim from daily problem sets. It&#8217;s a good idea to keep up with them as best you can. Some of them are repetitive. I trust you to use your discretion and work as many problems as you need to, until you understand what&#8217;s happening.</p>

<h3 id="weeklyhomework">Weekly homework</h3>

<p>Looking for the <a href="#dailyhomeworkreadingquizdates">daily homework</a>?</p>

<p>This is a senior-level mathematics course, and your homework should reflect the high level of professionalism you have developed in your studies. It should be clear, concise, readable, and grammatically correct; it should be made of paragraphs that are themselves made of sentences; and it should be convincing. If there is a gap in your argument, don&#8217;t try to hide it. Point it out and indicate exactly what is missing. Unsatisfactory write-ups earn no credit, no matter how obvious the underlying reasoning might appear to you.</p>

<p>If you are interested in typing your homework, I encourage you to learn the typesetting system <span class="math">\(\mathrm{\LaTeX}\)</span>. It is a valuable skill for people who plan to do any amount of scientific writing, and it is much easier today than it once was. I have loved using it for an embarrassingly long time and am happy to help you. See me if you are interested in getting started; you can learn most of what you&#8217;ll need for homework sets in an afternoon (it&#8217;s fun). All my syllabi, quizzes, exams, and other course handouts are typeset in <span class="math">\(\mathrm\LaTeX\)</span>, as are most professional mathematical books and articles (including graduate dissertations&#8212;at least, the dissertations of people who finish on time and do not have to hire Word professionals).</p>

<h4 id="problemset5:sections2.3--2.7brduefridaymarch22">Problem Set 5: Sections 2.3&#8211;2.7 <br /> due Friday, March 22</h4>

<ul>
<li>Section 2.3: 16.</li>
<li>Section 2.4: 7, 8. Also read and think about 9&#8211;14. These kinds of results have wider applicability than you might guess.</li>
<li>Section 2.5: 13. (You will probably need the result of 12, but the proof of 12 is not hard.)</li>
<li>Section 2.6: 1&#8211;3. The pictures are enough (you don&#8217;t need to discuss them at any length) but I want you to really think about them. Draw <em>big</em>, <em>beautiful</em> pictures for this problem.</li>
<li>Section 2.7: 2. (Ape the solution of Example 1.)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="problemset4:sections2.1--2.2">Problem Set 4: Sections 2.1&#8211;2.2</h4>

<ul>
<li>Section 2.1: 12, 13; Bonus: 14, 15.</li>
<li>Section 2.2: 9, 12, 25.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="problemset3:sections1.6--1.7">Problem Set 3: Sections 1.6&#8211;1.7</h4>

<ul>
<li>Section 1.6: 11, 12, 16; Bonus: 17.</li>
<li>Section 1.7: 6, 8, 9.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="problemset2:sections1.4--1.5">Problem Set 2: Sections 1.4&#8211;1.5</h4>

<ul>
<li>Section 1.4: 11 (with proofs or counterexamples), 18, 20, 22, 23.</li>
<li>Section 1.5: 1, 8, 10.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="problemset1:sections1.1--1.3">Problem Set 1: Sections 1.1&#8211;1.3</h4>

<ul>
<li>Section 1.1: 15&#8211;17, 24, 25; Bonus: 30.</li>
<li>Section 1.2: 6, 8, 10, 11.</li>
<li>Section 1.3: 10, 11, 22; Bonus: 28.</li>
</ul>

<p>On your first weekly grade report, the problems correspond as follows: 1.1.17; 1.1.24; (1.1.30); 1.2.8; 1.3.22; (1.3.28); 1.4.11; 1.5.10. Bonus problems appear in parentheses. They can contribute to the numerator when I calculate your homework score, but they contribute 0 to the denominator.</p></p>
