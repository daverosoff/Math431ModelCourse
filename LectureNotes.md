These notes are intended to complement the reading, not replace it. They may be a close approximation at first, but that will change as we go deeper into the material. The notes are typeset using the \\(\mathrm{\LaTeX}\\) document preparation system. If you like the look of the document and are interested in learning how to produce your own documents that look this way, I am happy to help you get started with \\(\mathrm{\LaTeX}\\).
