<h2>Lecture Notes for Math 431: Complex Analysis</h2>
<p class = "tip"><em class = "red">always refresh for up-to-date info</em></p><p><a href = "HW.html">Visit the homework page</a></p>

<p>These notes are intended to complement the reading, not replace it. They may be a close approximation at first, but that will change as we go deeper into the material. The notes are typeset using the \(\mathrm\LaTeX\) document preparation system. If you like the look of the document and are interested in learning how to produce your own documents that look this way, I am happy to help you get started with \(\mathrm\LaTeX\).</p>
