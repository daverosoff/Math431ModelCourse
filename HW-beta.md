### Daily homework, reading, quiz dates

Looking for the [weekly homework](#weeklyhomework)?

These problems are not to be turned in, but all quiz problems will come verbatim from daily problem sets. It's a good idea to keep up with them as best you can. Some of them are repetitive. I trust you to use your discretion and work as many problems as you need to, until you understand what's happening.

#### Daily problems: Week 6
- Friday, March 22: Finish 3.1.
    - Section 3.1: 1--3. 
- Wednesday, March 20: Exam 2. Review 3.1 for Friday.
- Monday, March 18: No daily problems; review for Exam 2.

#### Daily problems: Week 5
- Friday, March 15: Read 3.1. 
- Wednesday, March 13: Read 2.7 and skim 3.1. The best links so far that I have found for Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set are [here](http://classes.yale.edu/fractals/Mandelset/welcome.html) and [here](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Pictures_of_Julia_and_Mandelbrot_Sets/The_Mandelbrot_set). 
    - Section 2.6: No daily exercises.
    - Section 2.7: 1, 3a.

### Weekly homework

Looking for the [daily homework](#dailyhomeworkreadingquizdates)?

This is a senior-level mathematics course, and your homework should reflect the high level of professionalism you have developed in your studies. It should be clear, concise, readable, and grammatically correct; it should be made of paragraphs that are themselves made of sentences; and it should be convincing. If there is a gap in your argument, don't try to hide it. Point it out and indicate exactly what is missing. Unsatisfactory write-ups earn no credit, no matter how obvious the underlying reasoning might appear to you.

If you are interested in typing your homework, I encourage you to learn the typesetting system \\(\mathrm{\LaTeX}\\). It is a valuable skill for people who plan to do any amount of scientific writing, and it is much easier today than it once was. I have loved using it for an embarrassingly long time and am happy to help you. See me if you are interested in getting started; you can learn most of what you'll need for homework sets in an afternoon (it's fun). All my syllabi, quizzes, exams, and other course handouts are typeset in \\(\mathrm\LaTeX\\), as are most professional mathematical books and articles (including graduate dissertations---at least, the dissertations of people who finish on time and do not have to hire Word professionals).

#### Problem Set 5: Sections 2.3--2.7 <br /> due Friday, March 22
- Section 2.3: 16.
- Section 2.4: 7, 8. Also read and think about 9--14. These kinds of results have wider applicability than you might guess.
- Section 2.5: 13. (You will probably need the result of 12, but the proof of 12 is not hard.)
- Section 2.6: 1--3. The pictures are enough (you don't need to discuss them at any length) but I want you to really think about them. Draw *big*, *beautiful* pictures for this problem.
- Section 2.7: 2. (Ape the solution of Example 1.) 

#### Problem Set 4: Sections 2.1--2.2
- Section 2.1: 12, 13; Bonus: 14, 15. 
- Section 2.2: 9, 12, 25. 

#### Problem Set 3: Sections 1.6--1.7
- Section 1.6: 11, 12, 16; Bonus: 17.  
- Section 1.7: 6, 8, 9.  

#### Problem Set 2: Sections 1.4--1.5
- Section 1.4: 11 (with proofs or counterexamples), 18, 20, 22, 23.  
- Section 1.5: 1, 8, 10. 

#### Problem Set 1: Sections 1.1--1.3
- Section 1.1: 15--17, 24, 25; Bonus: 30.
- Section 1.2: 6, 8, 10, 11.
- Section 1.3: 10, 11, 22; Bonus: 28.

On your first weekly grade report, the problems correspond as follows: 1.1.17; 1.1.24; (1.1.30); 1.2.8; 1.3.22; (1.3.28); 1.4.11; 1.5.10. Bonus problems appear in parentheses. They can contribute to the numerator when I calculate your homework score, but they contribute 0 to the denominator.</p>
